# Python-Visualisor-UNI-Yr-1
This project is one of my first year projects at university, where I produced a Python application. The application captures an audio stream in chunks from the microphone, and process it to recognize frequencies with their associated amplitude.

The structure used on this project is pretty simple/rough as being my first time working on python, and trying to fit as much as possible before the deadline that was given at the time.


The project has been tested and should be fully functional on Python3 (3.11.1).

The project uses the following libraries:
(tested with the latest versions available at the time of upload)
 - Numpy (1.24.1)
 - PyAudio (0.2.13)

All other libraries used should already be included in Python3:
 - time
 - wave
 - msvcrt

Libraries that I am unaware if available or if they will be available:
 - opc
